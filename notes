You'll need to add a foreign key by writing your own migration.
You'll need to set up the association in the model classes.

In the controllers, this lab will require you to write show and index actions for both Song and Artist.

You'll need to format and link to the songs and artists according to the specs.

Additionally, you'll find that the specs require two special methods,
Artist#song_count and Song#artist_name. These methods are meant to protect the views from complexity
 that belongs in the model.
